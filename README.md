# TASK MANAGER
I made a basic CLI task manager application using Python.
You can get the code and modify it to your needs.
I will add comments sooner or later, depending on my un-laziness mood.
A future version will be made with a GUI.
For now, program uses 'deadline' values as float values. DD/MM as in example 12.12 states it's the 12th day of December.
Create a 'task_table.csv' file or the program will create it for you.
There is not any sorting features but i might add it.
